# rand [![PkgGoDev][godev-img]][godev] [![CI][ci-img]][ci]

Fast, high quality alternative to `math/rand` and `golang.org/x/exp/rand`.

Compared to these packages, `pgregory.net/rand`:

- is API-compatible with all `*rand.Rand` methods and all top-level functions except `Seed()`,
- is significantly faster, while improving the generator quality,
- has simpler generator initialization:
  - `rand.New()` instead of `rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))`
  - `rand.New(1)` instead of `rand.New(rand.NewSource(1))`
- is deliberately not providing top-level `Seed()` and the `Source` interface.

## FAQ

### Why did you write this?

`math/rand` is both slow and [not up to standards](
https://gist.github.com/flyingmutant/ad5841f5e594aa8687fe47de34985e6a)
in terms of quality (but can not be changed because of Go 1 compatibility promise).
`golang.org/x/exp/rand` fixes some (but [not all](
https://gist.github.com/flyingmutant/0b380f432308beaaf09c0a038f918aa4))
quality issues, without improving the speed,
and it seems that there is no active development happening there.

### How does this thing work?

This package builds on 4 primitives: raw 64-bit generation using `sfc64` or goroutine-local
`runtime.fastrand64()`, floating-point generation using floating-point multiplication,
and integer generation in range using 32.64 or 64.128 fixed-point multiplication.

### Why is it fast?

The primitives selected are (as far as I am aware) about as fast as you can go
without sacrificing quality. On top of that, it is mainly making sure the compiler
is able to inline code, and a couple of micro-optimizations.

### Why no `Source`?

In Go (but not in C++ or Rust) it is a costly abstraction that provides no real value.
How often do you use a non-default `Source` with `math/rand`?

### Why no top-level `Seed()`?

Top-level `Seed()` would require sharing global mutex-protected state between all top-level
functions, which (unlike the goroutine-local state used) does not scale when the parallelism increases.

### Why `sfc64`?

I like it. It has withstood the test of time, with no known flaws or weaknesses despite
a lot of effort and CPU-hours spent on finding them. Also, it provides guarantees about period
length and distance between generators seeded with different seeds. And it is fast.

### Why not...

#### ...`pcg`?

A bit slow. Otherwise, [`pcg64dxsm`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/random/bit_generators/pcg64dxsm.html)
is probably a fine choice.

#### ...`xoshiro`/`xoroshiro`?

Quite a bit of controversy and people finding weaknesses in variants of this design.
Did you know that `xoshiro256**`, which author describes as an "all-purpose, rock-solid generator"
that "passes all tests we are aware of", fails them in seconds if you multiply the output by 57?

#### ...`splitmix`?

With 64-bit state and 64-bit output, `splitmix64` outputs every 64-bit number exactly once
over its 2^64 period — in other words, the probability of generating the same number is 0.
A [birthday test](https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/birthday-test.html) will quickly find
this problem.

#### ...`wyrand`?

An excellent generator if you are OK with slightly lower quality. Because its output function
(unlike `splitmix`) is not a bijection, some outputs are more likely to appear than others.
You can easily observe this non-uniformity with
a [birthday test](https://gist.github.com/flyingmutant/cb69e96872023f9f580868e746d1128a).
On most modern platforms, top-level functions in this package use goroutine-local `wyrand`
generators provided by the runtime as the best compromise between quality and speed
of concurrent execution.

#### ...`romu`?

Very fast, but relatively new and untested. Also, no guarantees about the period length.

## Status

`pgregory.net/rand` is preparing for stable 1.0 release. Deterministic pseudo-random
generation produces the same results on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, both little-endian
and big-endian. After 1.0, any observable change to these results would only occur together
with a major version bump.
